#  Sagar Mohan

Hey, my name is Sagar Mohan. Like the title of the blog, the posts in this blog will be a mélange of different topics ranging from security, privacy to philosophy and physchology and whatever tickles my fancy at the time of writing.

# Research Experience
- Graduate Research Assistant, January 2023 -- Present
    - Presently engaged in the field of microcontroller security where I am using LLVM to instrument instructions at the compiler level to enable a security mechanism. This security mechanism is achieved using both a shadow stack frame and a modification of a debug monitor hardware called DWT to protect this shadow stack.
    - Designed and implemented to mitigate memory corruption attacks, enhancing the security posture of the system.
