Hey, my name is Sagar Mohan. I will be a PhD student at the [CactiLab](https://cactilab.github.io/) at the University at Buffalo from Fall 2024. Like the name of the blog implies, the posts in this blog will be a m√©lange of different topics ranging from security, privacy to philosophy and physchology and whatever tickles my fancy at the time of writing.
